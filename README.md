# Setup and Installation
Ubuntu 18.04 with ROS melodic. ROS was installed as according to this guide: http://wiki.ros.org/melodic/Installation/Ubuntu


TI mmWave ROS Package was downloaded to be used as a ROS node for the 1843AWRBOOST radar.

Step 2. Flashing was not neccesary and was therefore ignored. 

The 1843AWRBOOST was connected to the laptop with a USB cable. An external power supply was used for the radar.
